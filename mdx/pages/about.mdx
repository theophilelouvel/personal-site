# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

## TL;DR: I'm a full stack engineer / web developer focused on iteration and velocity, which I translated into the following stack of choice: Next.js / React / Sanity.io / MongoDB / Firebase / Tailwind. As a hobby I'm also learning Rust which I believe has a great future in web development.

It's tempting to say that I'm self-taught, but that would mean denying any external contribution to my education, which in fact is 100% of everything I know. I have a very proactive learning process, and when you seek information rather than waiting for it to come to you it's amazing how many great people you can cross paths with. I owe the community for everything I know and make, and I do try to *send the elevator back down*, as we say in French, when I can.

### Backstory

I'm actually an international busines law graduate ([la Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/)) who pivoted into web development and software engineering during 2020's pandemic and couldn't be happier about it. I had been messing around with code since high school for fun, but life's life and I never really made time to take things to the next step. So when I finally got the time, I went for it.

### Languages

Languages have always been my focus, no matter the form they may take. While learning the Legal language at university, I took upon myself to improve my English (as it turned out, *none* of my high school English teachers actually spoke the language, but that's a whole other topic). At some point along the way I started learning Turkish. Then Russian. Then design. And now programming languages. You probably get it now, I do have a strange fascination for Languages.

### Philosophy

I love learning them, I love practicing them, and I love teaching them. All of which I've been doing ever since I left university. Incidentally, those are the three necessary steps to become good at anything, and not necessarily in that order. Waiting to 'master' something before doing anything is,in my humble opinion, pure madness. In fact, I believe that *all* learning actually comes from doing and teaching, because it puts you on the spot and acts as a trigger, leaving you with no choice but to act and make the mistakes you need to know anything about anything. The key is obviously to avoid repeating them as much as possible.

### Ship, ship, ship

My mother is a painter. A talented one. It used to be normal for her to spend a week "perfecting" a painting. Then a month. Then a year. Until she kind of stopped painting, which of course she won't admit it you ask her. Perfectionism only leads to entropy, and I'm not going down that rabbit hole.

Perfection is the enemy, because it has nothing to do with the craft and everything to do with the ego. 

Which is why I try to prioritize things adequately (functionality vs hype), refrain myself from reinventing the wheel if I don't need to and ship as often as I can.

### Test, test, test, test

If you think something is a mistake, you should do it.

#### 

Don't reinvent the wheel if you don't need to!

Never underestimate the power of a working solution

great design comes from functionality

because design is a visual language

<!-- Languages are dynamics, they influence the speakers and the speakers influence them -->

<!-- being a dev vs developping smthg everyday -->

<!-- Ever since I turned 18 and left home I've been on the lookout for opportunities to learn, make and teach, which I believe are the 3 required steps to become good at anything. 

My main focus was and is languages 

Before that, I had a pretty wild journey since I turned 18 and left home - but that's another story, which you can read about here.

Full disclosure: I never really practiced the law craft after law school - if not for an internship at the French Ministry of Justice for 6 months.
