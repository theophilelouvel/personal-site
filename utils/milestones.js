The project grew and grew, but it's not until recently that I acquired the necessary skill to make it available for others. It's now a tiny React app styled with TailwindCSS deployed on Vercel! There are many more entries to add, but the functionality's here!",

At the same time, I used it to experiment working with Sanity and its Groq query language, which is a breeze, even though I came back to bare markdown articles later on as it was kind of overkill for my purpose.

With some friends we set out to learn programming, which was made possible thanks to the now extinct Site du ZÃ©ro (which featured tutorials maintained by engineering students). I chose C++ because I found systems programming mesmerizing (and I still do). I remember making programs to perform basic read / write operations on files, but nothing more. I must say I didn't get far as I had only school breaks to practice!",
